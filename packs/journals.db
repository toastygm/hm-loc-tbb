{"name":"Author's Preface","content":"<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\">This location is an example of how simple ideas can be expanded into full adventures and even larger campaigns. In early 2007, while preparing for my then-new campaign, I was looking for something I could use as an introductory scenario for a manor-based group of characters. Looking through Aaron Kavli’s Hârn Encounters fanon (available on Lythia.com), I found a brief adventure hook (on page 43, if you’re curious) entitled “So infer Goeth the Flock.” Since my campaign’s setting (the manor of Erthen, in Vemionshire’s Lynnfana Hundred) had a lot of sheep, I thought the hook of a missing shepherd would be a good way to get the various PCs all involved in an impromptu rescue effort. As I sketched out the small cave the poor shepherd had fallen into, I added a few twists. There needed to be some sort of threat for the PCs to overcome, so I made up a monster, an Ivashu that dwelt in the caves.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\">I thought that would be it, but then I happened to be looking at another piece of fanon, the excellent Naniom Bridge by Peter Fauconnier and Christophe Jaureguiberry, and got inspired again. The scenario “Brothers Awaiting” on page 30 of that article contained a wonderful idea for turpentine-soaked Jarin mummies guarding an ancient barrow tomb. I thought that such a tomb would make a great follow-up adventure to the rescue of the shepherd and altered my map to make the caves connect to a previously undiscovered barrow.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\">As I was detailing the various chambers, I made a few rolls on the HârnMaster treasure generation tables and ended up with a golden torc. On the surface, this was way too rich a treasure to have drop into the PCs hands, and I almost discarded the idea. But then it occurred to me that the torc could be something more than just a treasure to be sold. I had always liked the tale of Owain the Martyr from the description of Zoben Keep (see Kaldor 52), and decided the tomb was meant for him and his two younger brothers, who sought vengeance for his murder by Ceorlan the Betrayer. The curse of the golden torc would play well into one of the recurring plotlines I had envisioned for my campaign.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\">Whether you use this in a similar fashion or do something totally different, I hope it serves you well, and perhaps is the source of creative inspiration the way those earlier articles were a source for me.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"VxfDkDCdh37AOj9U":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.U8muDnT2Y6AvSh1x"}},"_id":"89w7WrEf4N8RyzHn"}

{"name":"Underground Hazards","content":"<h1>Underground Hazards</h1><div>\n<p>PCs exploring underground environments face several potential dangers. Here are some suggestions for handling a few of them according to HârnMaster 3 rules.</p>\n<h2>Falling Objects</h2>\n<p>When falling from a great height, natural or man-made objects can easily cause harm. Such falling objects can be caused by rockslides, earthslides, avalanches, falling timber, subterranean collapses (cave-ins), and structural collapses of walls, ceilings, and other engineering.</p>\n<p>In general, falling objects inflict Blunt (B) impact to the location(s) struck. This is usually rolled on the High Aiming Zone on the Strike Location Table but may vary if the victim is not sitting or standing. If the falling object warrants it, Edged (E) or Point (P) impact might be substituted for (or applied in addition to) Blunt impact. Damage is based in part on velocity. The base damage is 1d6 for every 10’ (or portion thereof).</p>\n<p>This works well enough for a single object but in some cases, there are actually many objects affecting an area. A cave-in or collapsing building, for example, may result in an uneven distribution of falling debris.</p>\n<p>Earthslides (sand, dirt, loose gravel, 10,000 marbles, etc.), mudslides, and avalanches behave more like liquids than as solids. Generally, they cannot be dodged or outrun. Instead of blunt trauma, their effect is to force a Stumble check. A character who falls receives damage as if they had fallen a distance equal to the distance the slide carries them, using the material modifier appropriate to the substance, and rolling hit location for every 1d6. In other words, it might be possible to suffer 10d6, distributed evenly, and walk away merely bruised, or to suffer 10d6, all to one location, resulting in death or serious injury.</p>\n<h2>Bad Air</h2>\n<p>In enclosed, poorly ventilated areas, there is a risk of encountering oxygen-depleted air. This can be exacerbated by open flames, which consume available oxygen.</p>\n<p>In HM3 terms, oxygen deprivation can be represented as Fatigue levels that begin accumulating once the oxygen levels fall below that required for normal functioning. The rate at which these accrue is dependent on the number of people, their activity level, any open flames, and possibly other factors, so the GM must decide. As a general guideline, assume F1 per five minutes and adjust as needed. Once a character’s fatigue exceeds their END, they lose consciousness and further fatigue is treated as END loss. Once END reaches zero, the character is dead.</p>\n<h2>Cold and Wet</h2>\n<p>Without sunlight or fires to provide warmth, underground environments can be cold, particularly for characters who get wet, and it is often exceedingly difficult to stay dry underground. Characters suffering from exposure to cold, wet conditions will have to expend more of their energy on maintaining body heat.</p>\n<p>To reflect this, an extra fatigue level is added whenever a character normally accrues one. However, if the character is particularly chilled, such as in an underground river, GMs may increase this to F2 or F3 as they deem appropriate.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"VxfDkDCdh37AOj9U":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":1400000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.pJ1sexzaiJoGD8F9"}},"_id":"kUDkgdGnK0kLPBEA"}

Four stout pine logs support the 12-foot peaked stone ceiling. With the passage of time, the pine resin oozing from the logs has left a residue around their bases and a powerful odor of turpentine. The floor of the chamber is painted in a detailed spiral with four smaller spirals around each of the columns. Within the spiral design are various renderings of men and beasts, all traveling towards the center where a serpent encircles Nolomar, the sun. The walls are decorated with stylized scenes of woodland, rivers, and mountains, while the ceiling is adorned with a pattern of stars around a light-colored disk that probably represents Yael, the moon.
