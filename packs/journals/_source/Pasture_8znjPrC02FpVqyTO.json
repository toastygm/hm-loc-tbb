Ideally, the pasture should be a short distance from the village and manor house, near enough that help can be summoned if needed but too far to simply shout for it.</p>\n<p>The pasture can be reached by a local road or trail, but to reach the site of the barrow itself involves trekking several hundred yards up a slope. Because of the recent rains, the conditions will be wet and mud may be a hindrance in places. The wet, muddy conditions may justify one or more tests of Agility if PCs are moving quickly, such as if trying to keep up with an anxious sheepdog.</p>\n<p>Visibility in the pasture may be limited by the weather conditions. On a clear day, however, the two hilltops offer a good vantage point to see much of the manor lands, especially to the southwest of the barrow.</p>",

Murrie, the ewe, and a mass of mud and loose stone were dropped into the cavern below. Any PCs entering the cave to search for the missing shepherd will be the first humans to explore it.</p>",
