Its scales are a dark gray coloration with an irregular pattern of dark red and violet along its underside. A series of small horn-like protrusions runs along its jaw, while a single horn juts upward several inches from the top of its skull. The Baethyr&rsquo;s small dark eyes are difficult to pick out from its scales.</p>\n<p>Because it spends most of its time underground, the Baethyr&rsquo;s vision is relatively poor. It possesses excellent hearing, however, and can detect movement, especially in water. The Baethyr can also detect scents through receptors in its forked tongue, allowing it to identify and track prey.</p>\n<p>Survivors of the Baethyr&rsquo;s psionic attack describe a sudden, devastating headache (akin to a migraine), often accompanied by dizziness and nausea. Victims frequently experience what may seem like flashes of lightning at the edges of their vision, and many lose consciousness.</p>\n<p>The Baethyr is able to navigate the flooded portions of most cave networks with ease, allowing it access into areas beyond the reach of most foes as well as to enter and exit the caves through nearby underwater openings. It can exploit this mobility to its tactical advantage when confronted by threats.</p>\n<h1>Special Abilities</h1>\n<p><em>Mental Bolt</em> psionic talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a psionic blast directed at a single mind within line of sight and no more than 45 yards away. A MS causes the victim to accrue two Fatigue levels (F2); CS inflicts four Fatigue levels (F4), which manifests as intense headache, dizziness, and nausea (the GM can vary the description based on how much Fatigue is accrued). After accruing the fatigue, the victim must immediately make a Shock Roll (see H&acirc;rnMaster, Skills 22) or pass out. The symptoms lessen until the Fatigue levels are recovered normally.</p>\n<h1>Attacks</h1>\n<p>The Baethyr has sharp teeth and can bite if necessary. However, it prefers to employ its psionic talent, Mental Bolt, to subdue prey. It usually feeds on fish but will sometimes emerge from its underground lair to prey on small animals, stunning them helpless before devouring them whole. The Baethyr will generally seek to avoid larger creatures, including humans, but will not hesitate to defend itself if it is cornered.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","macros":{"type":"script","command":""},"loadRating":0},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Snake Monster","displayName":50,"img":"modules/hm-loc-tbb/assets/images/baethyr-token.webp","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"1hZxFQfdyMzk8Kmw","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"shockIndex"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"J84HcvOcBrl0g5qR","name":"Initiative","type":"skill","data":{"notes":"","description":"","source":"HM3 Skills 18","macros":{"type":"script","command":""},"type":"Combat","skillBase":{"value":0,"formula":"@agl, @wil, @wil","isFormulaValid":true},"masteryLevel":0,"effectiveMasteryLevel":0,"ritual":{"piety":0},"improveFlag":false},"flags":{},"img":"systems/hm3/images/icons/svg/initiative.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"IUvLMhlo6H6yjSmB","name":"Unarmed","type":"skill","data":{"notes":"","description":"","source":"HM3 Skills 18","macros":{"type":"script","command":""},"type":"Combat","skillBase":{"value":0,"formula":"@str, @dex, @agl, Madada:2, Lado:2, Ulandus:2","isFormulaValid":true},"masteryLevel":0,"effectiveMasteryLevel":0,"ritual":{"piety":0},"improveFlag":false},"flags":{},"img":"systems/hm3/images/icons/svg/punch.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"mWJXgeSxCD100NQS","name":"Dodge","type":"skill","data":{"notes":"","description":"","source":"HM3 Skills 21","macros":{"type":"script","command":""},"type":"Combat","skillBase":{"value":0,"formula":"@agl, @agl, @agl","isFormulaValid":true},"masteryLevel":0,"effectiveMasteryLevel":0,"ritual":{"piety":0},"improveFlag":false},"flags":{},"img":"systems/hm3/images/icons/svg/dodge.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"DpNlUFUIpqMIJTFU","name":"Mental Bolt","type":"psionic","data":{"notes":"","description":"","source":"","macros":{"type":"script","command":""},"skillBase":{"value":13,"formula":"@aur, @aur, @wil","isFormulaValid":true},"masteryLevel":90,"effectiveMasteryLevel":0,"improveFlag":false,"fatigue":1},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/hm3/images/icons/svg/psionics.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ykPKBu8DWhDGBQcu":3,"J9LJZfy7UDqGwKQ1":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.ivashu.db.1hZxFQfdyMzk8Kmw"}},"_id":"LgSUIAx1RNcDJE9Y"}
