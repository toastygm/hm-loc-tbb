# HârnWorld Location Module: Three Brothers Barrow

Three Brothers Barrow is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. It is designed to provide
a ready-made Jarin barrow tomb for heroes to explore, along with several adventure hooks. 
This location module is designed for the [HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/)
fantasy setting; however, this barrowcould be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic, with the exception of Actors (a monster).
Detailed descriptions of the actors has been provided in journal entries to facilitate
conversion to other game systems.

# Maps

The original maps from this work have been used as inspiration, and new maps have been
designed specifically to meet the requirements of the VTT environment.  The following
